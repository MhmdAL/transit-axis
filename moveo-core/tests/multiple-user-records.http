### Multiple User Records Example
### Demonstrates how same person can have separate user records for different roles

### 1. Create Regular User (userType: 0)
POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/users
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Ahmed Al-Mahmoud",
  "phone": "+97412345678",
  "email": "ahmed@example.com"
}

### 2. Verify First User Created
GET http://localhost:3000/api/auth/users

### 3. Create Driver Profile for Same Person (userType: 1)
### This creates a SEPARATE user record for the driver role
POST http://localhost:3000/api/drivers
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Ahmed Al-Mahmoud",
  "phone": "+97412345678",
  "email": "ahmed@example.com",
  "licenseExpiry": "2025-12-31"
}

### 4. Verify Two Separate User Records Exist
GET http://localhost:3000/api/auth/users
### Should show 2 users with same phone but different userType

### 5. Verify Driver Created
GET http://localhost:3000/api/drivers

### 6. Try to Create Another Driver with Same Phone (Should Fail!)
POST http://localhost:3000/api/drivers
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Different Driver",
  "phone": "+97412345678",
  "email": "different@example.com",
  "licenseExpiry": "2025-12-31"
}

### 7. Test with Different Phone (Should Work)
POST http://localhost:3000/api/drivers
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Another Driver",
  "phone": "+97487654321",
  "email": "another@example.com",
  "licenseExpiry": "2025-12-31"
}

### 8. Final Verification - Should Have 3 Users Total
