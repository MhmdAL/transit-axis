### Multiple User Records Example - Driver Creation
### Demonstrates how same person gets separate user records for different roles

### 1. Create Regular User First
POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/users
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Ahmed Al-Mahmoud",
  "phone": "+97412345678",
  "email": "ahmed@example.com"
}

### 2. Verify User Created (userType: 0)
GET http://localhost:3000/api/auth/users

### 3. Create Driver with Same Phone (Should Create New User Record!)
POST http://localhost:3000/api/drivers
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Ahmed Al-Mahmoud",
  "phone": "+97412345678",
  "email": "ahmed@example.com",
  "licenseExpiry": "2025-12-31"
}

### 4. Verify Two Separate User Records Exist
GET http://localhost:3000/api/auth/users

### 5. Verify Driver Created
GET http://localhost:3000/api/drivers

### 6. Try to Create Another Driver with Same Phone (Should Fail!)
POST http://localhost:3000/api/drivers
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Different Driver",
  "phone": "+97412345678",
  "email": "different@example.com",
  "licenseExpiry": "2025-12-31"
}

### 7. Test with Different Phone (Should Work)

Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Another Driver",
  "phone": "+97487654321",
