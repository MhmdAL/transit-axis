### Multi-Profile User Example
### Demonstrates how the same person can have multiple profiles

### 1. Create Regular User (userType: 0)
POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/users
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John Smith",
  "phone": "+97412345678",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}

### 2. Create Driver Profile for Same Person (Should Create New User Record!)
### This will create a separate user record for the driver role
POST http://localhost:3000/api/drivers
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John Smith",
  "phone": "+97412345678",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "licenseExpiry": "2025-12-31"
}

### 3. Try to Create Another Driver with Same Phone (Should Fail!)
POST http://localhost:3000/api/drivers
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Different Driver",
  "phone": "+97412345678",
  "email": "different@example.com"
}

### 4. Verify Both Profiles Exist
### Get all users (should show both profiles)
GET http://localhost:3000/api/auth/users

### Get all drivers (should show driver profile)
GET http://localhost:3000/api/drivers
